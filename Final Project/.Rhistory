#### Exploratory Data Analysis
Using the functions "mean", "median" and "var", report the sample mean, sample median, and sample variance for both mobility and average rent as percentage of income. With this information, report the p-value for the null hypothesis that the true mean rent as a percentage of income is equal to 30 against the alternative hypothesis that the mean is not equal to 30. Do we reject this null hypothesis at level $\alpha = 0.05$?
$$H_0: E[\text{rentpct}] = 30 \hbox{ }\text{ vs. }\hbox{ }H_1: E[\text{rentpct}] \neq 30$$
Hint: recall that the estimated variance of Xbar is equal to the sample variance of X divided by n.
