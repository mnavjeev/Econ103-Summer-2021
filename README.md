# Econ103-Summer-2021
Files from teaching Econ 103, Introduction to Econometrics in Summer 2021. As always, anyone should feel free to use these feels without feeling the need to obtain permission or give credit. To compile the latex files, you will need to place either the "setup_beamer.sty" file (for compiling slide decks) or the "setup.sty" file (for compiling the homeworks), in the same directory as the .tex file.

The rough outline of topics covered is as follows:

## Week 1: Course Intro and Probability Review
- Why Econometrics?  
- Causation vs. Correlation 
- Probability Spaces, Continuous and Discrete Random Variables  
- Expectation, Variance, Covariance  
- Normal Distribution, Central Limit Theorem, and Law of Large Numbers  
- Homework 1

## Weeks 2-3: Single Linear Regression 
- Linear Regression as Line of Best Fit 
- Least Squares Estimation 
- Single Hypothesis Resting 
- R^2 and model evaluation 
- Hypothesis Testing of Linear Combinations 
- Heteroskedasticity
- Transformations of Variables
- Homework 2

## Weeks 4-5: Mutliple Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression as an extension of Single Linear Regression
- Least Squares Estimation
- Hypothesis testing for model parameters
- F-tests and multiple hypothesis testing
- Polynomial and Interatctionm odeling
- Adjusted R^2 and basics of model selection
- Omitted Varaibles Bias 
- Homework 3 

## Week 6: Causality
- Potential Outcomes Framework
- Challenges in Identifying Causal Parameters 
- Identification under Conditional Independence
- Identification using Instrumental Variables (Imbens and Angrist, 1994)
- Final Project

The midterm was taken during Week 4.
